* Press the left and right arrow keys. The AI will try to predict your next move.
* The learning algorithm uses context tree weighting and dynamic programming to predict behaviour in a computationally-efficient manner.
* The AI's behaviour is updated in an online-learning fashion after each move.
* The final algorithm is a modified version of the one presented in [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007396710653) paper.
